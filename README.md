KeePassX-classic
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This software is a fork of KeePassX 0.4.4. This fork is intended 
as a maintenance repository to keep the original KeePassX compilable
 on modern systems. New Features will typically not be added, however 
bug fixes are welcome.

KeePassX 2.x has recently been released, completely written 
from scratch. I suppose the intention there was to have a codebase 
that is easier to maintain and add additions to, however currently 
from a usability/feature standpoint, it's not as useful as just 
plain old 0.4.4.
